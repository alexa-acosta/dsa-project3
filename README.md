# Comparison of Hashmaps and Balanced BSTs for String Data Management

This project compares the performance of a hashmap and a balanced binary search tree (BST) for managing string data. I will analyze their efficiency in terms of execution time and memory usage for various operations like insertion and exact-match search.

## Project Details
* **Problem:** To determine the strengths and weaknesses of hashmaps and balanced BSTs for string data management.
* **Motivation:** Choosing an efficient data structure is crucial for large datasets to avoid impractical execution times and excessive memory usage.
* **Features:** The project will feature fully implemented hashmap and balanced BST data structures capable of handling at least 100,000 data points. We will measure and compare performance metrics.
* **Data:** I will use the U.S. County Demographics dataset from the CORGIS Datasets Project.

## How to Compile and Run
1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Download the dataset and place it in the `data/` directory.
3.  Ensure you have **MinGW-w64** installed with the `mingw32-make` utility and that its `bin` directory is in your system's PATH.
4.  Run `mingw32-make` in your terminal to compile the project.
5.  Execute `./main` to run the program.
